                    <br />
                    <h3>Adani Group shares fell sharply today</h3>
                    <p>By India Today Business Desk: All 10 listed shares of the Adani Group fell on Tuesday, with at
                        least four hitting the lower circuit of 5 per cent.

                        Flagship Adani Enterprises fell 7 per cent during the intraday trading session, and was down
                        over 5.3 per cent at Rs 1,630.85 per piece at around 12:50 am. Adani Ports was down 4.18 per
                        cent at Rs 602.80, while Adani Wilmar was down 4.22 per cent to Rs 371.15 per share.</p>

                    <p>Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas, Adani Power and Adani Transmission had all hit their lower
                        circuits, while Adani-owned Ambuja Cement and ACC were trading lower in the range of 1.2-2.8 per
                        cent. NDTV was also down over 4 per cent.
                    </p>
                    <h3>But why did Adani Group shares fall?</h3>



                    <p>The fall in Adani Group shares was triggered by a report by The Ken, which raised questions about
                        whether the group has actually repaid debts worth $2.15 billion.

                        "Despite the Adani Group's claim of “complete” repayment of $2.15 billion in share-backed debt,
                        regulatory filings show that banks have not released a significant portion of the promoters'
                        shares held as collateral, indicating that the debt has not been fully paid off," the Ken report
                        said.</p>

                    <p>Adani Enterprises, the flagship company of the Gautam Adani-owned conglomerate, rose 4.62 per
                        cent to Rs 1,674.75 apiece at around 10:15 am. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) was
                        also up 4.45 per cent to Rs 619.80.Adani Green Energy, Adani Wilmar, Adani Total Gas, Adani
                        Power and Adani Transmission were also 1-5 per cent higher. Adani-owned ACC, Ambuja Cement and
                        ACC also gained.</p>

                    <h3>Recovery after clarification on debt repayments</h3>
                    <p>The recovery comes after Adani Group CFO Jugeshinder Singh refuted a news report which questioned
                        its recent debt repayments.

                        Hours after he rejected the claim, the company also issued a statement, where it said, “Adani
                        has completed full prepayment of margin linked share backed financing aggregating to USD 2.15
                        billion and all corresponding shares pledged for those facilities have been released.”

                    </p>
                    <p>Singh also added that the data will be updated on the exchanges after the end of the currency
                        quarter.He added that the publication could have simply seen the group’s public disclosure of
                        the payments and it could have “easily verified that all margin loans of the promoters have been
                        paid in full”.</p>

                    <h3>What did the news report claim?</h3>
                    <p>Jugeshinder Singh’s statement was in response to a report by The Ken, which raised questions
                        about whether the Adani Group had actually repaid debts against pledged shares totalling to
                        $2.15 billion.

                        The report also claimed that Adani Group only reduced the loan amount through a partial
                        repayment to avoid pledging more shares and further action by lenders.</p>
                    <p>It also added that following the prepayment announcement, lenders only released pledged shares of
                        Adani Ports.

                        It may be noted that the Adani Group had announced earlier this month that it had prepaid $2.15
                        billion of share-backed financing. However, the report published by The Ken claimed otherwise.

                        Rejecting the claim, the Adani CFO said: "The deliberate subterfuge will be clear to all once
                        exchanges update the data post end of the quarter."</p>
