                    <h3>Kia EV9 SUV to get 541km range, Level 3 ADAS</h3>
                    <h6>The EV9 gets multiple battery options; GT-line gets sporty exterior design bits as well.</h6>
                    <p>Kia has now announced specifications, range and other details of the EV9, days after revealing
                        the exterior details of the full-size born-EV SUV. The EV9 was showcased in India earlier this
                        year at Auto Expo 2023 as a concept.</p>
                    <p>1. Kia EV9 SUV is almost as long as the standard Range Rover</p>
                    <p>2. Performance oriented EV9 variant reveal in future</p>
                    <p>3. 6-seater versions get swivelling seats</p>
                    <h3>Kia EV9 dimensions, powertrain options</h3>
                    <p>The Kia EV9 SUV measures 5,010mm in length and has a wheelbase of 3,100mm, which makes it almost
                        as long as the standard-length Range Rover. The EV9, however, has a longer wheelbase than the
                        British SUV, thanks to its E-GMP skateboard electric platform.</p>
                    <p>The entry-level version will come with a 76.1kWh battery that will be offered in select global
                        markets. There will also be a 99.8kWh, 800V battery netting a range of up to 541km between
                        charges, which is capable of gaining 238km range in just 15 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, Kia will also offer the EV9 with RWD and 203hp that goes from 0-100kph in 9.4sec.
                        There's also a dual-motor version bumping that up to 383hp and 599Nm, which trades some of that
                        range for a rapid 6.0sec 0-100kph time. Kia will also introduce an EV9 GT Performance variant
                        that will be revealed at a later date.</p>
                    <p>For now, the range-topping variant is the ‘assertive’ EV9 GT-Line, marked out by its bespoke
                        bumpers, wheels and roof rails – together with the dynamic LED patterns in the front ‘grille’
                        panel previewed by the EV9 concept.</p>
                    <h3>Kia EV9: tech on offer, design details</h3>
                    <p>The EV9 will be available after launch in certain markets with a new "highway driving pilot"
                        system that uses 15 sensors (including two Lidar devices) to offer level-three autonomous
                        driving “where conditions permit”. </p>
                    <p>With regards to its silhouette and definitive design cues, the production-spec EV9 remains
                        heavily faithful to the radical concept Kia first showed at Los Angeles in 2021, but it rides
                        noticeably closer to the ground – courtesy of a much thicker battery pack and 21-inch wheels in
                        place of the concept’s 23s (19-inch and 20-inch items will be available) – and has softened out
                        some of the show car’s sharpest edges.</p>
                    <p>But ultimately, the EV9 is much more recognisable as an SUV than the rakish, low-slung EV6. It
                        gets chunky black body cladding (available in gloss or matte), is a clearly defined two-box
                        silhouette, while highlighting some of the more non-conventional cues that nod to the EV9’s
                        electric underpinnings.</p>
                    <p>Some of the EV9's defining cues that will go on to influence future models include the
                        distinctive trapezoidal creases on its rear quarters, its visibly stretched greenhouse (possible
                        due to the lack of an engine), kinked rear window line, selection of striking new wheel designs
                        and – most obviously – its ‘star map’ LED light signatures at the front and rear.</p>
                    <p>The latest version of Kia’s tiger face ‘grille’ also makes its debut here, though, without any
                        need for engine cooling, it now takes the form of an expansive smooth panel which can be
                        decorated with customisable LED light patterns shining through from behind – as was the case
                        with the concept.

                        The headlights and tail-lights also play an important design role – being vertically oriented
                        and mounted right on the corners of the body to make the EV9 appear as wide as possible.</p>
