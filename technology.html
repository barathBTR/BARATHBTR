                    <p>Elon Musk and other tech experts have alleged that the AI could represent a profound change in

                        development of AI systems for atleast six months
                        In the letter, Musk and his counterparts have suggested that the AI labs and independent experts
                        should use this pause.</p>
                    <p><b>By Ankita Chakravarti:</b> In a tweet, Elon Musk had hinted that the AI war could soon end
                        civilisation and turns out he was not joking about it. He was in fact pretty serious. A report
                        now states that the Twitter chief has signed an open letter calling for a halt on development of
                        AI systems for atleast six months. He and other tech experts have alleged that the AI could
                        represent a profound change in the history of life on earth. The letter mentions that the AI
                        labs are currently engaged in a lethal race to outshine each other in the AI race. </p>
                    <p>They are
                        locked in an “out-of-control race” to create systems “that no one — not even their creators —
                        can understand, predict, or reliably control.”</p>
                    <p>"Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI
                        systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all
                        key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute
                        a moratorium," the letter signed by Musk read. It further mentions that the AI systems should be
                        developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be
                        manageable.</p>
                    <p>In the letter, Musk and his counterparts have suggested that the AI labs and independent experts
                        should use this pause and jointly develop and implement a set of shared safety protocols for
                        advanced AI design and development that "are rigorously audited and overseen by independent
                        outside experts". These protocols should ensure that systems adhering to them are safe beyond a
                        reasonable doubt. However, by asking the developers to stop working on AI products for a brief
                        period of time does not mean pausing on AI development in general. The letter suggests that it
                        is merely a stepping back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models
                        with emergent capabilities.</p>
                    <p>"In parallel, AI developers must work with policymakers to dramatically accelerate development of
                        robust AI governance systems. These should at a minimum include: new and capable regulatory
                        authorities dedicated to AI; oversight and tracking of highly capable AI systems and large pools
                        of computational capability; provenance and watermarking systems to help distinguish real from
                        synthetic and to track model leaks; a robust auditing and certification ecosystem; liability for
                        AI-caused harm; robust public funding for technical AI safety research; and well-resourced
                        institutions for coping with the dramatic economic and political disruptions (especially to
                        democracy) that AI will cause," the letter said.</p>
