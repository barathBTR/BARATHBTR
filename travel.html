                    <h3>Istanbul: Bridging the gap between East and West, one ferry at a time</h3>
                    <p>With a skyline featuring a mosque dome next to a cathedral, a glinting skyscraper shadowing an
                        ancient Jewish hospital and a high-end shopping street ending in a traditional bazaar, Istanbul
                        bridges the gap between Europe and Asia.</p>

                    <p>By Riya Baibhawi : “Merhaba! Welcome to Istanbul. Could you step back and look into the camera,
                        please?” said the immigration official as I landed in Turkey on January 27. Who knew that just a
                        week later, this beautiful country would witness its worst natural disaster in a century - an
                        earthquake that would kill nearly 50,000 people? But as of now, I was in Constantinople (now
                        known as Istanbul), a city that conjured the Romans, the Ottomans and still continues to bewitch
                        people across all faiths and religions.</p>

                    <p>Istanbul or Islambol was established in May 1453 by Fatih Sultan Mehmet as the centre of Islam.
                        The 21-year-old prince had annihilated the unbreakable walls of Constantinople, standing true to
                        the Prophet’s words and bringing the great Byzantine Empire to its knees.</p>

                    <p>I was transfixed the moment I first soaked in the beauty of Istanbul. The squeaks of seagulls on
                        the Bosphorus Strait, the aroma of spices and fresh fishes in the Kapalicarsi or Grand Bazaar,
                        the kaleidoscope of colours in Karakoy, the transcontinental city that stood largely on the
                        masterpieces of Mimar Sinan and Genoese merchants, could charm anybody.</p>
                    <h3>The unique mix</h3>
                    <p>As I spent my days in the financial capital of Turkiye, commuting between the serenity of Florya
                        and the historic waterfront neighbourhood of Sultanahmet, I could hear Azan from the
                        1,486-year-old Hagia Sophia mosque located in the vicinity. However, as I walked east from the
                        Eminonu neighbourhood, through its highly gentrified and cobblestoned streets, to the Golden
                        Horn, I could see a part that one could easily mistake for Lisbon or Paris. This part of
                        Istanbul encompassed a highly organised tram system, glinting nightlife and opulent shopping
                        streets amongst other things, thanks to the Father of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal
                        Ataturk.</p>
                    <h3>A foodie’s paradise</h3>
                    <p>Istanbul is a boon for those with a sweet tooth. As somebody who had already spent months in
                        Egypt, I was familiar with most of the sweets the Mediterranean city had to offer. However, what
                        distinguished Istanbul from others was its historic Ottoman traditions.</p>
                    <p> For instance, the Turks
                        served Kahvesi (Turkish coffee) with water (Lokum/Turkish delight in ancient times). It was
                        believed that if the guest picked water first, they were hungry and the host was obliged to
                        serve them food. And, if they picked coffee first and drank water on top of that, then the guest
                        was believed to dislike the taste of the coffee.</p>
